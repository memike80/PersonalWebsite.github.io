Interesting about me is that I used to study Chinese Literature and had already gained a bachelor degree. You might wonder why does a Literature student came to America to study Computer Science? Great question! As an arts enthusiast and gamer, I'm always interested in visualzing arts and liturature to people. As the time goes by, internet has become the most powerful medium that connects peope around the world. Lots of great creations have the combination of technology and humanity. It fascinated me and drove me to seek the possibilites for combining my skills and Computer Science.</p></div>
